    <p>New York, often called New York City[a] or NYC, is the most populous city in the United States. With a 2020
        population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is the most densely
        populated major city in the United States and more than twice as populous as Los Angeles, the nation's
        second-largest city. The city also has a population that is larger than that of 38 individual U.S. states. New
        York City is located at the southern tip of New York State. The city constitutes the geographical and
        demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest
        metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and urban area. With over 20.1 million people in its
        metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York is one of
        the world's most populous megacities, and over 58 million people live within 250 mi (400 km) of the city.[11]
        New York City is a global cultural, financial, entertainment, and media center with a significant influence on
        commerce, health care and life sciences,[12] research, technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art,
        fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for
        international diplomacy,[13][14] and is sometimes described as the capital of the world.[15][16]

        Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors and extending into the Atlantic Ocean, New York City
        comprises five boroughs, each of which is coextensive with a respective county of the state of New York. The
        five boroughs, which were created in 1898 when local governments were consolidated into a single municipal
        entity, are: Brooklyn (in Kings County), Queens (in Queens County), Manhattan (in New York County), The Bronx
        (in Bronx County), and Staten Island (in Richmond County).[17]

        As of 2021, the New York metropolitan area is the largest metropolitan economy in the world with a gross
        metropolitan product of over $2.4 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would
        have the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York City is an established safe haven for global
        investors.[18] New York is home to the highest number of billionaires,[19][20] individuals of ultra-high net
        worth (greater than US$30 million),[21] and millionaires[22] of any city in the world.

        The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As
        many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[23] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.
        New York City is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the U.S., the largest foreign-born
        population of any city in the world as of 2016.[24]

        New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch
        colonists in approximately 1624. The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam) in 1626 and was
        chartered as a city in 1653. The city came under British control in 1664 and was renamed New York after King
        Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[25][26] The city was regained by the
        Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously
        named New York since November 1674. New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[27]
        and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came
        to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of
        liberty and peace.[28] In the 21st century, New York City has emerged as a global node of creativity,
        entrepreneurship,[29] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity.[30] The New York Times has won the most
        Pulitzer Prizes for journalism and remains the U.S. media's "newspaper of record".[31] In 2019, New York City
        was voted the greatest city in the world in a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its
        cultural diversity.[32]

        Many districts and monuments in New York City are major landmarks, including three of the world's ten most
        visited tourist attractions in 2023.[33] A record 66.6 million tourists visited New York City in 2019. Times
        Square is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District,[34] one of the world's busiest
        pedestrian intersections[35] and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[36] Many of the city's
        landmarks, skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world, and the city's fast pace led to the phrase New
        York minute. The Empire State Building is a global standard of reference to describe the height and length of
        other structures.[37]

        Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world.[38][39] Providing continuous 24/7
        service and contributing to the nickname The City That Never Sleeps, the New York City Subway is the largest
        single-operator rapid transit system in the world with 472 passenger rail stations, and Penn Station in Midtown
        Manhattan is the busiest transportation hub in the Western Hemisphere.[40] The city features over 120 colleges
        and universities, including some of the world's top universities.[41] Its public urban university system, the
        City University of New York, is the largest in the nation.[42] Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District
        of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world's leading financial and fintech center[43] and
        the most economically powerful city in the world,[44] and is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by
        total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.[45][46]

        The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, part of the Stonewall National Monument, is considered the historic
        epicenter of LGBTQ+ culture[47] and the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement.[48][49] New York City is
        the headquarters of the global art market, with numerous art galleries and auction houses collectively hosting
        half of the world's art auctions; and the Metropolitan Museum of Art is both the largest and most visited art
        museum in the United States and hosts the globally focused Met Gala haute couture fashion event annually.[50]
        Governors Island in New York Harbor is planned to host a US$1 billion research and education center as a leader
        in the climate crisis.[51]
